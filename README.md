# Ping-Pong-game

This Python script implements a simple two-player Pong-like game, where each player controls a paddle using designated keys to prevent a ball from passing their side. The game employs various technical features to enable functionality and enhance user experience. It utilizes the `os` module for clearing the console screen, `time` module for controlling game speed and delays, and `keyboard` module for handling player input. The game offers three difficulty modes, adjusting the speed of the ball and paddles accordingly. The game state, including paddle positions, ball position, and scores, is displayed using ASCII characters within the console. The script incorporates functions to manage player movement, ball motion, scoring, and difficulty level adjustments. Through a blend of console graphics, user input, and game logic, players engage in a competitive and entertaining arcade-style experience reminiscent of classic video games.
